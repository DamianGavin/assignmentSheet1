## Motivation

Third year software development at GMIT. This is my first introduction to the **Go** programming language

## Installation

This repository can be found at https://github.com/DamianGavin/assignmentSheet1

## Running the code

First you must have "Go" on your computer. This can be found and downloaded at https://golang.org/.
If you navigate to the folder that contains these files you can type :
go run <file name> to run the code.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
**EXAMPLE**
